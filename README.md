*** Quine
A quine is a program that outputs its own content.<br>
An empty program or program that opens and reads its file is prohibited.

**** Colleen
A quine program in c that outputs itself in the console.
%c displays char and %s displays a string.<br>
In printf 10 is ASCII code for \n and 34 for ".<br>
Between % and c or s, 1$ refers to 10 and 2$ TO 34 and $3 to str.<br>
Basically a string representing the program is printed which is also able to print itself by using a self referential embedded format tag.

Outputs its content in another file..

****Sully
The program creates a new file, writes its own content into that file and executes the file, leading to the creation of another file who also created another file and so on,  leading to a self-replicating program which is useful for viruses to propagate.
